## mindmap todo

    - Investigate Conway's Game of life
        - what are the rules, how does it work ?
        - What is turing completeness?
        - what is cellular automata
    - Research tools and techniques to visualize
        - implement double buffering (use a redux store to hold the next state of the cells)
        - !!! this may determine how I set up some of my logic, this is a priority !!!
        --- First just work on creating a 50x50 grid
    - write the algorithm (of course)
        # ALGO NOTES
            - Each cell has potentially up to 8 neighbors to account for.
            - How to handle cells at the border? Count the non existent neighbors as perma-dead cells in the algo?

## TODO ORDER V#1
    - create a grid
    - make grid boxes interactive/stateful
    - THEN dig more into the Game Of Life
    - Reasses once I have more of a foundation to plan on.
